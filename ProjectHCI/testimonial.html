It then arrived a week later, even when I bought the cheapest delivery option, meaning it was meant to arrive after 14-40 days of dispatch. Couldn't be better!</p>

Shipping is fast, I like how they send you a picture of the items before, and everything has been received with no damage (everything bubble wrapped and posters in cardboard tubes). I have had problems with other websites but none with Del Luna.</p>

                <p class="titlerev">Great Company! Great Customer Service!</p>
                <p class="contentrev">I wish the DEL LUNA website allows us to write reviews because this store is honestly great. Their customer service is very responsive (I always receive a reply in a few hours). My pre-order item shipped out the next day after release, and I was even able to add another item to my order just before it was shipped because customer service processed my request so quickly. They also send photos of your order before it is shipped so you know what your order looks like. Honestly, best customer service ever! I'm so impressed, 100% would recommend.</p>

                <p class="titlerev">My favorite kpop site</p>
                <p class="contentrev">Ok honestly, I never write reviews. But this website is my absolute favorite and idk it doesn’t deserve the bad reviews it gets. I think I made my first order with them around 2015 (back then I even contacted them to cancel it and they did within 2 days) and they’re still my go to choice when it comes to kpop merch and beauty products. What I like most is that they send a photo of your package (like the products that are inside as well as the information on the top) so you know everything is correct.</p>

                <p class="contentrev">I ordered two light sticks recently and one of them came in broken, I contacted customer service and they responded really quickly! After checking with the manufacturer of the product they gave me a refund. I would totally recommend this place!!!</p>
